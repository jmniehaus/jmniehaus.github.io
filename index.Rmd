I am currently a Master's student in the Department of Statistics at Texas A\&M University. I received my M.A. in political science from Texas A\&M University in 2020, and my B.A. in both political science and psychology from the University of Missouri in 2014. On this site you will find a set of posts on various topics which I wanted to learn, as I find that I learn best when trying to explain things. However, please note that all topics have been published on extensively, with appropriate citations included for all content. 

For my CV, or to visit my GitHub page, see the links above. To contact me via email please run the following code in R, or for those unfamiliar with R, please copy and paste the code into [this](https://rdrr.io/snippets/) site and press run.

```{r klippy, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
klippy::klippy(position = c('top', 'right'),
               tooltip_message = 'Click to copy', 
               tooltip_success = 'Done',
               color = "white")
```

```{r, echo=T, eval=F, results='hide', class.source="klippy"}
paste(c(rev(c(paste(sort(c(5,2,7,2)),collapse= ""),
              paste0(sort(c("us","e","ha")),collapse=""),
              "jni")),"@gmail.com",sub("@yahoo.com","", ""),
        sub("@outlook.com","","")),collapse="")
