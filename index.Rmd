In the Fall of 2020, I will be a Master's student in the Department of Statistics at Texas A\&M University. I received my M.A. in Political Science from Texas A\&M University in 2020, and my B.A. in both political science and psychology from the University of Missouri in 2014. During my time in political science, I published papers on both human rights and political methodology, as well as assisted with teaching graduate-level time series analysis. Methodologically, I am interested in time series analysis and machine learning, and applying both to the prediction of state violence.
