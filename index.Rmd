I am a data scientist in the mortgage industry, received my M.S. in statistics in 2021 from Texas A\&M University, and my M.A. in political science in 2020. On this site you will find a set of posts on various topics which I wanted to learn, as I find that I learn best when trying to explain things.

I am also the author and maintainer of the `bizicount` R package, available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bizicount/index.html), or the dev version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/jmniehaus/bizicount). To notify me of issues with the package, 
please use the [issues](https://github.com/jmniehaus/bizicount/issues) section on GitHub. I cannot guarantee responses to bug reports via email.

For my resume, or to visit my GitHub page, see the links above. To contact me via email please run the following code in R, or for those unfamiliar with R, please copy and paste the code into [this](https://rdrr.io/snippets/) site and press run.



```{r klippy, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
klippy::klippy(position = c('top', 'right'),
               tooltip_message = 'Click to copy', 
               tooltip_success = 'Done',
               color = "white")
```

```{r, echo=T, eval=F, results='hide', class.source="klippy"}
paste(c(rev(c(paste(sort(c(5,2,7,2)),collapse= ""),
              paste0(sort(c("us","e","ha")),collapse=""),
              "jni")),"@gmail.com",sub("@yahoo.com","", ""),
        sub("@outlook.com","","")),collapse="")
```
